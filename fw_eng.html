<h1>Senior Firmware/Embedded Software Engineer</h1>

<p><strong>Live Aware Labs</strong> is a next generation usability and research lab focused on solutions and services tailored for Geospatial AR dev teams. We enable teams to develop deep insights into live player experiences.</p>

<p>We make it easy for teams to integrate professional usability at all stages of development. The results? Higher quality experiences developed in less time and cost.</p>

<p>Our proprietary Usability Tools, Technologies and Services enable development teams to conduct live, remote, continuous observation of many simultaneous participants as they explore the world through geospatial AR experiences. With our proprietary Live Link technology, it is now possible for entire teams to “ride along” the user’s entire experience from the player’s point of view from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Our <strong>Live Link</strong> technology was designed from the ground up as a highly versatile, lightweight, mobile streaming solution that streams real-time video of players POV (via a wearable camera), their device display, as well as other critical data streams (including biometric feedback, live analytics, geopositional data, etc) across the internet to teams around the globe. With Live Link, AR development teams can observe the live experiences of multiple simultaneous users to quickly understand group dynamics as users interact with the real world and each other.</p>

<p>Live Aware Labs is currently on the hunt for an exceptional Senior Firmware/Embedded Software Engineer to help us level up the performance and feature set of Live Link. Qualified candidates are at home with kernel configuration, writing device drivers, and helping to debug both hardware and software interfaces. An ideal candidate is constantly curious about the state of the art, committed to long term quality, and highly collaborative.
